Python 2/3 port related
=======================
* Refactor transport.py (lot's of repetition)
* Verify if transport.py filters really need to be lists instead of iterators
* hostkeys.py has cruft from pre 2.4 (some comments about sets being nice)

Other stuff
===========
* Change license to BSD for v1.8 (obtain permission from Robey)
* Pending that, remove preamble from all files, ensure LICENSE is still correct
* Update version stuff: use an execfile'd paramiko/_version.py
